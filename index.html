            <p>
              I was born in Kiev, Ukraine and I was very active child – I love
              sports. At the age of 13 I joined fitness class.I quickly became
              interested learning everything I could about nutrition. I tested
              many diets, especially those that were scientifically proven. I
              should say it was not so easy for me to change my food habits
              completely. I was practicing yoga for several years. I even tried
              vegetarian diet. I learned to stay disciplined, determined and
              goal minded. As a result of my determination, felt healthier,
              energized, happy and inspired to reach higher goals and standards
              for myself. In 2006 I began lifting serious weights and with
              assistance of yoga, and nutritionally rich meals, I noticed how my
              body began to change fast. I concentrated on better understanding
              how protein functions in the body and the effects of proper diet
              application. I became an expert. Despite challenges in live, such
              us destroyed marriage followed by depression and other general
              complications associated with living in poor country, I remained
              motivated and goal oriented. Workouts at the gym kept me focused
              on my goals.

                So this is me around a year ago on the left. My weight is about
                230 lbs. I've maintained this super unhealthy weight for about
                two years and couldn’t really do much about it. I lived and
                Europe and ate unhealthy, irregular and junk. I think it was
                around February when I met my amazing trainer- Olga. This day
                changed my life to the better and believe it or not I hate
                writing reviews orcomments but this is a life miracle . This is
                me on the right today. My weight is 206lbs and this is
                definitely not the end result. I didn't workout constantly
                because of my work schedule and chaotic life moments, but this
                is where we are now. Do I feel better? Yes! Do I want to lose
                more and gain more myself? Hell Yeah! This is not even a mid
                point but I am very happy! Olga is a great trainer and a life
                coach. She is always there for me. she helped me to be present
                in the moment and most importantly she motivated me to believe
                in myself! I am thankful for this meeting and after seeing
                results, I want to get better and better. Hold me accountable
                guys!
